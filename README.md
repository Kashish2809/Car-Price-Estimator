_**Car Price Estimator**_

A Machine Learning web application that predicts the selling price of used cars based on various features like age, showroom price, kilometers driven, fuel type, and more. Built with Flask, Python, and Scikit-Learn.

**Overview :**

Buying a used car can be tricky, and estimating the fair market price is often the hardest part. This project aims to solve that problem by using a Random Forest Regressor model trained on historical car sales data. Users can input specific details about a car, and the application will output an estimated selling price.

**Features :**

**Accurate Predictions**: Uses a Random Forest algorithm for reliable price estimation.

**User-Friendly Interface:** Clean, responsive web interface designed with modern CSS and Glassmorphism effects.

**Real-time Calculation:** Instant results upon form submission.

**Categorical Data Handling:** Automatically processes inputs like Fuel Type and Transmission into machine-readable formats.

**Tech Stack :**

Frontend: HTML5, CSS3

Backend: Python, Flask

Machine Learning: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy

Serialization: Pickle

**Dataset :**

The model is trained on the Vehicle Dataset from Cardekho, available on Kaggle.
